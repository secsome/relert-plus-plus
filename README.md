## Motivation

The project is a rewrite of Final Alert 2, a map editor for Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2 and Command and Conquer: Yuri's Revenger and their mods.
The time is ripe for the project's starting from my prespective, as the disassembling work on it is almost done.
Even though the community has started almost 3 modern map editor projects (as far as I know), I personally think this project is quite meaningful.

The project is not aiming at the original bugged FA2, but will take it as a reference, and try to fix or even improve it based on my earlier FA2sp stuff.  

## Current state of the project
Still managing to introduce the classes.
